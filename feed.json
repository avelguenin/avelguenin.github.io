            "content_html": "<p>I am a complex systems researcher building an integrated conception of life, cognition, and culture as an enactive dynamical process across scales. I draw from both philosophical and computational tools to understand <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> complex functional entities assemble in living systems, and what it means to exist as such a unit. I seek to discover what processes underlie the emergence of social organisation in human history, and what it means for our collective future and our role as situated humans in shaping it.</p>\n<p>I want to participate in building societies that will withstand the test of the so-called Anthropocene era, which I extend my research work beyond classical (academic) institutions. I founded and coordinate the <a href=\"https://kairos-research.org\">Kairos</a> participative research &amp; scientific mediation collective which focuses on synthesising complexity-oriented approaches to social sciences. I also work on a cooperative project aimed at integrated synergic research-action approaches to the transition to help institutional actors navigate real world complexity.</p>\n<p>I have a broader commitment to reveal what’s below sensible reality and beyond the means of our linguistic grasp. This is why I’m interested in various ways to convey meaning without the need for formal language, from (classical) graphical design to creative ventures. I write an uchronical fiction which seeks to expose the intrication of spirituality and power by conveying the subjective view point of protagonists and bystanders in the historical dynamics by which a neognostic cult asserts itself as an hegemonic geopolitical power then desintegrate into civil warfare.</p>\n",
