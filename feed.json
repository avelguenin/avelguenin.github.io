Its mandate is to bring complexity science and active inference to the service of collective organisation through systems management lessons, platform design for collective intelligence, and augmented intelligence systems. I also do systems modelling and scientific tutoring on systems science. Feel free to <a href=\"(avel@kairos-research.org)\">contact me</a> if I could be of any help to your project !</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>I have spend the last few years building the outline of an uchronical fiction on spirituality, power, and history. It is constituted by a web of related stories collectively drafting the progressive institution of a neognostic Temple of Tyr as an hegemonic geopolitical power and its consequent desintegration into internal warfare. Each story captures how a specific actor participates in this trajectory, and seeks to convey how their particular perspective derive from but also participate in shaping historical dynamics beyond their all too human compehension.</p>\n<p>The central goal of this project is to convey at an intimate level how power derives ultimately from the renunciation to control. All characters become entangled to some level in the Temple’s affairs, and their unbalances are turend into leverages to bring them into the role they are expected to fulfill. The Temple’s institutions, the strategies and attitudes of its militant, the esoteric doctrine they practice and the exoteric doctrine they prache progressively reveal its underlying ethics, which holds the ability to shape the material world through spiritual power as the only kind of virtue.</p>\n<p>Exerpts will be published as I see fit.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>I am a complex systems researcher who participates in the construction of an integrated conception of life, cognition, and culture as an enactive dynamical process across scales. I draw from both philosophical and computational tools to understand <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> complex functional entities assemble in living systems, and what it means to exist as such a unit. I seek to discover why particular systems create meaning, how this process is embedded in the evolution of human societies, and what it means for our role as situated humans in shaping the collective future.</p>\n<p>I want to participate in building societies that will withstand the test of the so-called Anthropocene era, which I extend my research work beyond classical (academic) institutions. I have founded and currently coordinate the <a href=\"https://kairos-research.org\">Kairos</a> participative research &amp; scientific mediation collective which focuses on synthesising complexity-oriented approaches to social sciences. I also work on a cooperative project aimed at integrated synergic research-action approaches to build governance systems and actors network that can navigate real world complexity.</p>\n<p>I have a broader commitment to reveal what’s below sensible reality and beyond the means of our linguistic grasp. This is why I’m interested in various ways to convey meaning without the need for formal language, from (classical) graphical design to creative ventures. I am especially interested in exploring the ethics of impermanence through graphism and fiction. I write stories exploring how actors struggling to impose meaning onto a shifting and ultimately inaccessible reality, and how this process ultimately shapes the evolution of human societies.</p>\n<p>You can find me on <a href=\"https://osf.io/vhk7x/\">OSF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/avelguenin\">Github</a>, or contact me by <a href=\"avel@kairos-research.org\">mail</a>.
