Its mandate is to help social systems build an appropriate understanding of their reality, and therefore make their experience subjectively predictable (ergodic). In time, our activity will ecompass systems management lessons, counsel for collective intelligence, augmented intelligence systems, and embodied artificial intelligence. I also do interventions and conferences for the <a href=\"sfec.website/\">French Society of Cliodynamics</a>, as well as systems modelling and scientific tutoring on systems science.

It is constituted by a web of related stories collectively drafting the progressive institution of a neognostic Temple of Tyr as an hegemonic geopolitical power and its consequent desintegration into internal warfare. Each story captures how a specific actor participates in this trajectory, and seeks to convey how their particular perspective derive from but also participate in shaping historical dynamics beyond their all too human compehension.</p>\n<p>The central goal of this project is to convey at an intimate level how power derives ultimately from the renunciation to control. All characters become entangled to some level in the Temple’s affairs, and their unbalances are turend into leverages to bring them into the role they are expected to fulfill. The Temple’s institutions, the strategies and attitudes of its militant, the esoteric doctrine they practice and the exoteric doctrine they prache progressively reveal its underlying ethics, which holds the ability to shape the material world through spiritual power as the only kind of virtue.</p>\n<p>Exerpts will be published as I see fit.</p>\n",

I seek to discover why particular systems create meaning, how to represent that process mathematically / computationnally, and what it means for the evolution of the universe and of human societies. I am currently employed as a PhD student working on the co-evolution of the human mind and material culture under the supervision of Andy Clark and Chris Buckley.</p>\n<p>I’m also a coordinator for <a href=\"https://kairos-research.org\">Kairos Research</a>, participative research &amp; scientific mediation collective which focuses on buildingsituated knowledge for us to navigate ongoing socio-historical dynamics. We do so by synthesing pre-existent complexity-oriented approaches to social sciences, but also by developping a political epistemology that is thoroughly grounded on the dynamics of living and cognitive systems. We also aim to build a research-action cooperative tmandated to enact governance systems and actors network that can navigate real world complexity and withstand the constraints of the Anthropocene.</p>\n<p>I have a broader commitment to reveal what’s below sensible reality and beyond the means of our linguistic grasp. This is why I’m interested in various ways to convey meaning without the need for formal language, from (classical) graphical design to creative ventures. I am especially interested in exploring the ethics of impermanence through graphism and fiction. I write stories exploring how actors struggling to impose meaning onto a shifting and ultimately inaccessible reality, and how this process ultimately shapes the evolution of human societies.</p>\n<p>You can find me on <a href=\"https://osf.io/vhk7x/\">OSF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/avelguenin\">Github</a>, or contact me by <a href=\"avel@kairos-research.org\">mail</a>.
